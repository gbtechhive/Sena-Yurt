                    <p> Our yurts are 100% handmade with high quality. Every yurt is unique!
                        As a handmade product of natural materials, you cannot expect the precision of an industrial
                        product, which is part of its charm.
                        Although they are based on ancient designs, we are constantly improving our yurts to adapt them
                        to European climates, always respecting Mongolian traditions and the needs of our customers.
                        A well cared for yurt can live for many years! Since the natural life cycle of its material is
                        fulfilled, it is common to replace it with parts. So, for example, it is expected that the
                        canvas will be updated first, and then the wood will be updated later.

                    <p> In Mongolia, for example,
                        parents inherited domes and pieces of wood from yurts to their children, indicating great
                        durability. </p>
